# SmartShell API Demo

This project contains a script demonstrating the API integration flow for
SmartShell integrations. It is meant to be used as reference code.

## Usage

```
./index.js <path to office action PDF>
```

The script will print out a URL to visit in a browser to continue the flow,
simulating an integration redirecting the user's browser after performing the
appropriate API calls.
